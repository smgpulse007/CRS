# Basic Autonomous Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) Guide

Building a basic Autonomous Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) involves creating a simplified framework that can autonomously detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats. This guide focuses on leveraging open-source tools and technologies to create a manageable and scalable system.

## Step 1: Define the Scope and Objectives

- **Scope:** Determine what systems, networks, or applications your CRS will cover.
- **Objectives:** Define clear objectives for your CRS, such as identifying vulnerabilities, detecting and responding to attacks, or ensuring compliance with specific standards.

## Step 2: Setup the Environment

- **Hardware/Cloud:** Decide whether to run your CRS on physical hardware or in a cloud environment.
- **Operating System and Dependencies:** Choose an operating system (Linux is commonly preferred) and install necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Data Collection

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Use tools like Wireshark or Bro/Zeek for network monitoring.
- **System Logs:** Configure Syslog for Unix/Linux systems to collect system and application logs.
- **Vulnerability Feeds:** Integrate public vulnerability databases to receive updates on new vulnerabilities.

## Step 4: Threat Detection

- **Signature-Based Detection:** Implement Snort for network traffic monitoring.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn in Python to develop models that identify unusual patterns.

## Step 5: Analysis and Reasoning

- **Automated Reasoning:** Develop logic-based systems using Prolog or a rule engine in Python.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Train models on historical data to predict the behavior of potential threats.

## Step 6: Response and Mitigation

- **Scripted Responses:** Create scripts to automate responses to common threats.
- **Incident Response Tools:** Integrate with tools like TheHive for managing incident response processes.

## Step 7: Continuous Learning

- **Feedback Loop:** Implement mechanisms to log the outcomes of the CRS's actions.
- **Update Models and Rules:** Regularly retrain your machine learning models and update your rule sets.

## Step 8: Interface and Reporting

- **Dashboard:** Use an open-source dashboard tool like Grafana to visualize data and alerts.
- **Alerts:** Configure email or SMS notifications for high-severity incidents.

## Step 9: Security and Compliance

- **Secure Your CRS:** Ensure your CRS components are secure, using encryption and implementing strong access controls.
- **Compliance:** Regularly audit your CRS against relevant compliance frameworks and standards.

## Step 10: Documentation and Training

- **Documentation:** Document the setup, configuration, and operation of your CRS.
- **Training:** Train staff on how to interact with the CRS and interpret its outputs.

Building a basic CRS is an ongoing process that involves continuous refinement and adaptation to new threats. Start small and gradually expand the system's capabilities as you gain more insights and experience.
